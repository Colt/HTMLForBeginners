<h1>Pigeon Racing</h1>


<p>Pigeon racing is the sport of releasing specially trained homing pigeons,
which then return to their homes over a carefully measured distance. The
time it takes the animal to cover the specified distance is measured and
the bird's rate of travel is calculated and compared with all of the other
pigeons in the race to determine which animal returned at the highest
  speed.</p>


<p>Pigeon racing requires a specific breed of pigeon bred for the sport, the
Racing Homer. Competing pigeons are specially trained and conditioned for
races that vary in distance from approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) to
1,000 kilometres (620 mi). Despite these lengths, races can be won and
lost by seconds, so many different timing and measuring devices have been
developed. The traditional timing method involves rubber rings being
placed into a specially designed clock, whereas a newer development uses
  RFID tags to record arrival time.</p>

<p>The "Brazilian Pigeon Racing Grandprix" is the biggest pigeon race in

  from Aracaju organise this event.</p>


<h1>United States</h1>

The sport was introduced into the United States about 1875, although
regular racing did not begin until 1878.[25] The sport of pigeon racing is
well established in the US,[26] and growing. According to the American
Racing Pigeon Union, one of two large accrediting groups, there are 15,000
registered lofts in the U.S.[27]


<h1>Europe</h1>

  <h1>Belgium</h1>

<p>The Janssen brothers (Louis, Charel, Arjaan and Sjef) were a famous and
successful pigeon racing family from Arendonk, Belgium. Louis Janssen,
born 1912, was the last-surviving of the famous brothers. He died on 16
April 2013, at the age of 100.[36] Descendants of the brothers' pigeons
  can be found racing all around the world.</p>

<h1>UK and Ireland</h1>

<p>The first regular race in Great Britain was in 1881.[25] The British Royal
Family first became involved with pigeon racing in 1886 when King Leopold
II of Belgium gave them breeding stock. The tradition continues to this
day, and a bird of Queen Elizabeth II winning a race in 1990.[38] The
sport is declining in the UK with membership of recognised clubs and
  federations falling by about five per cent annually.[39]</p>
